# Offensive-Defensive-Network-Analysis

I worked as a security engineer for a company supporting the SOC infrastructure. For Offensive security, I attacked and assessed a Wordpress server. For Defensive Security, I created pre-determined alerts on Kibana to monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities. For Network Analysis, I used analyze Wireshark malicious network traffic.
